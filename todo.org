* game.js
 * look at handleCollisionWithPaddle
 * look at handleCollisionWithWall
 * very ugly -> handleCollisionWithBricks

* controller.js
 * look at nested for loop in createBricks function
 * reduce startGame function

* apply physics at collisions
* manner of ball & brick collision is not consistent
